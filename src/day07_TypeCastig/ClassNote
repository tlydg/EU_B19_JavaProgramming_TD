            7. Casting (implicit-Automatic-Widening, explicit-manual- narrowing)
            8. Scanner class


            Arithmetic Operators
            + - * \ %
            ()  işlem önceliği


            Casting
            implicit -- casting smaller type to larger
            explicit -- casting the larger type to smaller ( veri kaybı)


                Scanner

                        1. adim Scanner Classindan bir object nesne olusturuyoruz
                           Scanner scan/input/scanner/  = new Scanner(System.in);

                        2. use scanner methods to get input from user
                           nextInt()
                           nextDouble()
                           nextBoolean()
                           nextLine()   - entera kadar
                                if we are using nextLine() method after a scanner methods (nextInt , NextDouble ...)
                                We must use an extra nextLine()

                        3.  close scanner
                                scan.close();
